intro to github - apouchie
Hi peeps. I'm Asia and I am learning to code so that I can become a Full Stack Developer. I'm currently a middle school technology teacher which is why I have gained interest in coding and programming. I'm also a full-time single mom with ADHD so I'm a bundle of chaos lol.
